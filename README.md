# Arduino Pen

## Motivation
During the covid-19 pandemic, many people have to work from home. For those who used to do heavy paperwork, the transition from paper to computer typing may not be smooth and easy. However, most of the stylus pens on the market only work on a touchscreen device, which donâ€™t provide the physical feedback of writing on paper. Therefore, we would like to design an electronic pen that can write on the paper and transcribe handwritten characters into computer notes. 

## Goal
Our goal is to build a stylus pen on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE microcontroller, and utilize the machine learning skill to transcribe 0-9 digits and simple math operators (+, -, *, /, =)  written on a horizontal surface.
